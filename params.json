OkBuck aims to provide a gradle plugin, which will do these buggy job for you automaticlly after few lines configuration.\r\n\r\nFurther more, you can still use OkBuck to maintain your BUCK build system when your gradle configurations changes, OkBuck let you even needn't write one line of the magic BUCK script! \r\n\r\n## Full example\r\nConfigurations in root project `build.gradle` file:\r\n\r\n```gradle\r\nbuildscript {\r\n    repositories {\r\n        jcenter()\r\n    }\r\n    dependencies {\r\n        classpath 'com.github.piasy:okbuck-gradle-plugin:1.0.0'\r\n

`jcenter()` must be added into `buildscript` and `allprojects`' `repositories` list, and must add before `apply plugin`\r\n+  `buildToolVersion` specifies the version of the Android SDK Build-tools, default `23.0.1`\r\n+  `target` specifies the Android target sdk version, which could be abtained by `<sdk home>/tools/android list targets --compact`, default `android-23`\r\n+  `overwrite` is used to control whether overwrite existing BUCK files, default `false`\r\n+  `checkDepConflict` is used to control whether check dependency conflict, default `true`\r\n+  `resPackages` is a map, used for specifing Android library module and Android Application module's package name for generated resources, its key is module's name, value is package name, must be specified, it should be the same as `package` part in corresponding `AndroidManifest.xml` file\r\n+  `linearAllocHardLimit` and `primaryDexPatterns` are maps, used for specifing linearAllocHardLimit and primaryDexPatterns used by BUCK multidex, more details about multidex configuration, please read [multidex wiki page](https://github.com/Piasy/OkBuck/wiki/Multidex-Configuration-Guide), if you don't need multidex (not enable it in `build.gradle`), you can ignore these two parameters\r\n+  `exopackage`, `appClassSource` and `appLibDependencies` are maps, used for configuring BUCK exopackage mode, more details about exopackage configuration, please read [exopackage wiki page](https://github.com/Piasy/OkBuck/wiki/Exopackage-Configuration-Guide), if you don't need exopackage, you can ignore these three parameters\r\n+  `flavorFilter` is a map, used for controlling OkBuck only generate BUCK files for flavors you need, default is empty, which will generate all flavors BUCK file\r\n+  After apply OkBuck plugin (sync project after modify root project `build.gradle` file), two tasks are added into your gradle project , `okbuck`, and `okbuckClean`\r\n  +  `okbuck` will generate all flavor (you specified) and variant BUCK configs, and each flavor + variant combination will have an BUCK alias\r\n  +  `okbuckClean` will **delete all** files/dirs generated by OkBuck and BUCK\r\n+  After execute `./gradlew okbuck`, there will be a `.buckconfig` file in your project root dir, inside it, there are lots of BUCK alias, e.g. `appDevDebug`, `appProdRelease`, `anotherappDebug` etc, which you could use to run BUCK build, e.g. `buck build appDevDebug` etc\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting\r\nIf you come with bugs of OkBuck, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Piasy/OkBuck/issues/new), and it's really appreciated to post the output of `./gradle okbuck --stacktrace --debug` at the same time, or you can join our BUCK QQ group: `170102067`.\r\n\r\n## After apply OkBuck successfully\r\nOkBuck can only generate BUCK configs for you, so if your source code is incompatible with BUCK, you need do more jobs.\r\n\r\nRead more on [Known caveats wiki page](https://github.com/Piasy/OkBuck/wiki/Known-caveats). \r\n\r\nMaybe there are more caveats waiting for you, but for the super fast build brought by BUCK, it's worthwhile.\r\n\r\nThe rest modules in this repo is a full example usage of OkBuck and BUCK.\r\n\r\n## Who is using OkBuck?\r\nUser | Repo\r\n--- | ---\r\n[Piasy](https://github.com/Piasy) | [AndroidTDDBootStrap](https://github.com/Piasy/AndroidTDDBootStrap)\r\n\r\nIf you are using
