OkBuck aims to provide a gradle plugin, which will do these buggy job \r\nfor you automaticlly after few lines configuration.\r\n\r\nFurther more, you can still use OkBuck to maintain your BUCK build system when \r\nyour gradle configurations changes, OkBuck let you even needn't write one line \r\nof the magic BUCK script! \r\n\r\n## Who is using OkBuck?\r\n LOGO | User/Org | Repo \r\n--- | --- |

list.\r\n\r\n## Minimum example\r\nConfigurations in root project `build.gradle` file:\r\n\r\n```gradle\r\nbuildscript {\r\n    repositories {\r\n        jcenter()\r\n    }\r\n    dependencies {\r\n        classpath 'com.github.piasy:okbuck-gradle-plugin:1.0.0-beta5'\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nallprojects {\r\n    repositories {\r\n        jcenter()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\napply plugin: 'com.github.piasy.okbuck-gradle-plugin'\r\n\r\nokbuck {\r\n    resPackages = [\r\n            dummylibrary: 'com.github.piasy.okbuck.example.dummylibrary',\r\n            app         : 'com.github.piasy.okbuck.example',\r\n            anotherapp  : 'com.github.piasy.okbuck.example.anotherapp',\r\n            common      : 'com.github.piasy.okbuck.example.common',\r\n            emptylibrary: 'com.github.piasy.okbuck.example.empty',\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Explanations\r\n+  OkBuck hosts on jcenter, so `jcenter()` must be added into `buildscript` and \r\n`allprojects`' `repositories` list, and must add before `apply plugin`\r\n+  `resPackages` is a map, used for specifing Android library module and Android \r\nApplication module's package name for generated resources, its key is module's name, \r\nvalue is package name, must be specified, it should be the same as `package` part \r\nin corresponding `AndroidManifest.xml` file\r\n\r\n## Full example\r\n```gradle\r\nokbuck {\r\n    buildToolVersion \"23.0.1\"\r\n    target \"android-23\"\r\n    overwrite true\r\n    checkDepConflict true\r\n    resPackages = [\r\n            dummylibrary:

  ]\r\n    primaryDexPatterns = [\r\n            app: [\r\n                    '^com/github/piasy/okbuck/example/AppShell^',\r\n                    '^com/github/piasy/okbuck/example/BuildConfig^',\r\n

'multidex',\r\n                    'javalibrary',\r\n            ]\r\n    ]\r\n    flavorFilter = [\r\n            app: [\r\n                    'dev',\r\n                    'prod',\r\n            ]\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Full explanations\r\n+  `buildToolVersion` specifies the version of the Android SDK Build-tools, default `23.0.1`\r\n+  `target` specifies the Android target sdk version, which could be abtained by \r\n`<sdk home>/tools/android list targets --compact`, default `android-23`\r\n+  `overwrite` is used to control whether overwrite existing BUCK files, default `false`\r\n+  `checkDepConflict` is used to control whether check dependency conflict, default `true`\r\n+  `linearAllocHardLimit` and `primaryDexPatterns` are maps, used for specifing \r\nlinearAllocHardLimit and primaryDexPatterns used by BUCK multidex, more details \r\nabout multidex configuration, please read \r\n[multidex wiki page](https://github.com/Piasy/OkBuck/wiki/Multidex-Configuration-Guide), \r\nif you don't need multidex (not \r\nenable it in `build.gradle`), you can ignore these two parameters\r\n+  `exopackage`, `appClassSource` and `appLibDependencies` are maps, used for \r\nconfiguring BUCK exopackage mode, more details about exopackage configuration, \r\nplease read [exopackage wiki page](https://github.com/Piasy/OkBuck/wiki/Exopackage-Configuration-Guide), \r\nif you don't need exopackage, you can ignore these three parameters\r\n+  `flavorFilter` is a map, used for controlling OkBuck only generate BUCK files for flavors \r\nyou need, default is empty, which will generate all flavors BUCK file\r\n+  After apply OkBuck plugin (sync project after modify root project `build.gradle` file), \r\ntwo tasks are added into your gradle project , `okbuck`, and `okbuckClean`\r\n  +  `okbuck` will generate all flavor (you specified) and variant BUCK configs, and each \r\n  flavor + variant combination will have an BUCK alias\r\n  +  `okbuckClean` will **delete all** files/dirs generated by OkBuck and BUCK\r\n+  After execute `./gradlew okbuck`, there will be a `.buckconfig` file in your project \r\nroot dir, inside it, there are lots of BUCK alias, e.g. `appDevDebug`, `appProdRelease`, \r\n`anotherappDebug` etc, which you could use to run BUCK build, e.g. `buck build appDevDebug` etc\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting\r\nIf you come with bugs of OkBuck, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Piasy/OkBuck/issues/new), \r\nand it's really appreciated to post the output of `./gradle okbuck --stacktrace --debug` \r\nat the same time, or you can join our BUCK QQ group: `170102067`.\r\n\r\n## After apply OkBuck successfully\r\nOkBuck can only generate BUCK configs for you, so if your source code is incompatible \r\nwith BUCK, you need do more jobs.\r\n\r\nRead more on [Known caveats wiki page](https://github.com/Piasy/OkBuck/wiki/Known-caveats). \r\n\r\nMaybe there are more caveats waiting for you, but for the super fast build brought by BUCK, it's worthwhile.\r\n\r\nThe rest modules in this repo is a full example usage of OkBuck and BUCK.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\nOkBuck is tested under `gradle` 2.2.1 ~ 2.10, and `com.android.tools.build:gradle` 1.5.0. \r\nOther versions will not considered compatible, if you have compatibility problem, please \r\nfire an issue.\r\n\r\nExceptions:\r\n\r\n+  gradle 2.4 need force jdk version to 1.7, [ref1](http://stackoverflow.com/a/21212790/3077508) \r\nand [ref2](http://stackoverflow.com/a/18144853/3077508)\r\n\r\n## Contribution\r\nAny form of contributions are welcome!
